# JIT-Sandwich  
It is my hope that this project will some day be a full system emulator. I am currently in the early stages of development; so, I chose a scholastic architecture in order to prove out the JIT compiler. That architecture is CHIP-8 due to its reduced instruction set, simplicity, and my familiarity with it.
